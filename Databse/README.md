## Transactions & Concurrency

### Q: What does the ACID acronym mean in databases?
**Answer:**
ACID defines the fuarantees of reliable transactions in relational databases:
  - **Atomicity** - all operations succeed or none do.
  - **Consistency** - a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
  - **Isolation** - transactions don't interfere; efects are not visible until commited.
  - **Durability** - once commited, data survives crashes or power loss.

Together, these ensure data correctness and reliability.

## Indexes & Optimization

### Q: What is the downside of using indexes in relational databases?
**Answer:**

Indexes speed up read queries but have trade-offs:
  - **Slower writes** - inserts, updates, and deletes must also update the index.
  - **Extra storage** - indexes take additional disk space.
  - **Maintenance cost** - poorly chosen or too many indexes can hurt performance instead of helping.

### Q: What are the isolation levels in databases?
**Answer:**

Isolation levels control how transactions interact when running at the same time.
They balance **consistency** vs **performance**. The ANSI SQL standart defines 4 levels:

  1. **Read Uncommited** - can see uncommited changes (dirty reads).
  2. **Read Commited** - only commited data visible (no dirty reads).
  3. **Repeatable Read** - same query in a transactions are fully isolated (like running one after antoher).
  4. **Serializable** - highest isolation; transactions are fully isolated (like running one after another).

Higher isolation = more consistency but less concurrency.
