## System Design Basics

### Q:  
**Answer:**  

---

## Scalability

### Q:  
**Answer:**  

---

## Caching

### Q: How would you calculate the efficiency of a cache system like Redis?
**Answer:**

Cache efficiency is usually measured by the **cache hit ratio**:

$$
\text{Hit Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cache Hits}}{\text{Cache Hits} + \text{Cache Misses}}
$$

  - **Cache Hit** - request served from cache.
  - **Cache Miss** - request not in cache, fetched from the database.

A higher ration = more effective cache.

Other metrics:
  - **Latency Reduction** - compare response time with and without cache.
  - **Cost savings** - fewer DB queries or reduced server load.

## Load Balancing

### Q:  
**Answer:**  

---

## Database in System Design

### Q: How can you scale databases?
**Answer:**
Scaling can be done in two main ways:

  - **Vertical scaling (scale up)** - add more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server. Simple but limited and expensive.
  - **Horizontal scaling (scale out)** - add more servers and distribute data/load across them. Common strategies:
    - **Replication** - copy data to multiple servers (improves read performance and availability).
    - **Sharding (partitioning)** - split data into chunks by key/range and distribute across servers (improves write scalability).
    - **Caching** - reduce database load using in-memory stores like Redis.
